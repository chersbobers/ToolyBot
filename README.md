# Overview

Booly bot (or better tooly) is a fork of my original discord bot tooly bot this is a updated fork that is easier to develop and use.

Fork freely just credit booly 

# Installation

there is 2 methods of install:
1. prehosted 100 servers limit servers can be slow and updates are tested there.
2. self host it

## Prehosted

[Click me for invite](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1466398693383995558&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands)
notes: again servers will most likely be slow and only 100 servers at a time if it reaches over a 100 servers I might host another one links will be updated.

## Self hosting

I recommended using the main stable repo (https://github.com/chersbobers/booly) for yours but the nightly branch is usable too (https://github.com/chersbobers/booly/tree/nightly)

### what you need

A server I use render because im broke with uptimerobot (note: Oregen servers are ip banned for me they might not be for you)

Also a discord bot with Presence Intent, Server Members Intent and Message Content Intent

Envs:
DISCORD_TOKEN (your bot token)
PORT 3000

For the invite link it just needs bot and applications.commands
